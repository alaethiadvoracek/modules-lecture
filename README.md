#NODE MODULES 
- server: listens for requests 
##LECTURE NOTES
- Requests: get request: default requesst that happens on any route( any time you hit a route it creates a get request) just loading something in the browser
- post: Pass in information and post the request (here is some data and I want you to do something with it.) getting information from a page, clicking on a button or link 
- creating a new route doesn't create a new folder but a new route in the browser to get something else to load
- server.js is just showing what server is doing
- cars.js is showing just the logic of the cars object that is being 
displayed on the DOM 
- using cars( ) can display the object as a function (look at servers.js line 15);
